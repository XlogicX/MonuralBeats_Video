# MonuralBeats_Video
Script for generating music video for Monural Beats song

# Image Sourcing
Took image of Pearl drum kit from Guitar Center:

# ASCII Conversion

# Beat Log.txt Source
https://github.com/XlogicX/SamsaraSonicPi/blob/master/Monural%20Beats.rb  

When played in Sonic-Pi, a log is generated. The log.txt is a cleaned up (with the power of regex) version of that.

# Running
So long as all the kit .txt files and log.txt files are in the same place as the video.py, this script should run without too many issues; as time, re, and curses are typically standard python3 built-ins.
